# Semantic search for YouTube videos

In this project, a search system for youtube videos is build using a semantic search method. The user is able to search a particular video by typing a keyword or multiple keyworkds and the system will display the relevant videos based on the seach and provide links for the recommended videos. This project was done following the tutorial from [Shaw Talebi](https://www.youtube.com/@ShawhinTalebi).
